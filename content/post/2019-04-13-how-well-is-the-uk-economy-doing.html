<p>A question which crops up repeatedly in political discussions concerns the macroeconomic performance of the UK economy since the ending of the Great Recession of 2008-09. To answer this question we (probably) need to examine the time path of <strong>UK real GDP per head</strong> both historically and in comparison with other similar industrialised nations.</p>

<h2>Real GDP per head</h2>
<p>Why real GDP per head? What exactly is that? GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product - it’s a measure of the value of the total output of goods and services produced in an economy in a given period. Now in order to calculate the value of output of any firm or industry the government statisticians have to use the current prices of each product or service. This measure is known as GDP in current prices. But these prices change over time. So that presents a problem in determining whether the economy is producing a greater volume of goods and services in one period compared to another. Just comparing GDP in current prices in different periods won’t tell us because this measure will change partly because of volume changes but also partly because of changes in prices. So in order to determine whether an economy is producing a greater or lesser volume of goods and services in one period compared to another we need a measure of GDP that removes the effects of changing prices: this is called Real GDP. (Technically, it involves measuring GDP at chained volume measures (CVM) rather than current prices)</p>
