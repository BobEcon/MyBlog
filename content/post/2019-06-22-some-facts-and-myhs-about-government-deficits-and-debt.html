<p>Ever since the Great Recession, and the policies which many government’s enacted in response, led to a significant rise in their deficits and debt, there has been repeated discussion about the nature and sustainability of public finances. Unfortunately, much of this discussion has been ill-informed and confused. In this post, I will attempt to give a clear explanation of what the government deficit and debt levels are, how they are connected, and how they evolve over time.</p>
<div id="what-is-the-deficit-what-is-the-debt" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the deficit, what is the debt?</h2>
<p>Some people, including journalists and politicians, sometimes confuse the government’s deficit with its debt.</p>
<ul>
<li>The government’s overall budget balance <em>over a given period of time</em>, say a quarter or a year, is the difference between its total income and its total expenditure. If income exceeds expenditure, it has a surplus; if its expenditure exceeds its income, it has a deficit.</li>
<li>The level of the government’s debt is the total amount of borrowing outstanding (i.e. money owed) <em>at a particular point in time</em>, say, for example, at the end of the financial year.</li>
<li>If the government has a surplus it will use this to pay off some debt and thus reduce its level; conversely, if there is a deficit, the level of debt will increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/april2019">UK Office of National Statistics (ONS)</a>, “Borrowing in the latest full financial year (April 2018 to March 2019) was £23.5 billion.” This was the overall deficit of the UK public sector which includes central government, local government and public corporations. Also, according to the ONS, “Debt (public sector net debt excluding public sector banks) at the end of April 2019 was £1,797.7 billion.”</p>
</div>
<div id="deficit-and-debt-as-of-gdp" class="section level2">
<h2>Deficit and debt as % of GDP</h2>
<p>These sound enormous figures and politicians and other commentators often use them to sound the alarm over the “parlous” state of the public finances. But it is not the absolute amounts of the deficit and debt which really matter. It’s the size of the deficit and debt as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which is important. Imagine two individuals each with a total debt of, say, £2000. The first person has an income of £10000 per year, the second has an annual income of £100000. Although the absolute level of debt is the same for both individuals, it’s clear that the burden of that debt is much higher for the first person than the second. Servicing and repaying a debt which is one fifth of your income is much harder than a debt which is only one fiftieth. So, it’s important to consider the <em>relative</em> size of debt (to income) rather than just the absolute amount.</p>
<p>When it comes to the deficit and debt of the government, its income is effectively national income, i.e. GDP, as it is this which constitutes the tax base. The larger is GDP the more taxation revenue the government could potentially raise in order to service and pay off the debt. Hence, the larger is GDP for any given absolute level of debt, the lower the burden of the debt on the public finances<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Again, according to the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/april2019">UK Office of National Statistics (ONS)</a>, public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) was 82.7% of GDP at the end of April 2019, whilst public sector borrowing (the deficit) in the latest full financial year (April 2018 to March 2019) was 1.1% of GDP.</p>

<h2>Deficit and Debt over time</h2>
<p>Are these UK deficit and debt ratios particularly high compared to the past? Looking at the historical record, the charts below show the deficit (net borrowing) and debt ratios, from 1956 for the deficit and from 1975 for the debt<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1: UK Deficit/GDP ratio
</p>
</div>
<p>In Figure 1, the deficit to GDP ratio appears to be on a rising trend over the period from financial year 1955-1956 to 2018-2019, but with a lot of fluctuations.These fluctuations around trend correspond, for the most part, to the booms and slumps in the economy. When the economy is booming, i.e. GDP growth is relatively high, the deficit ratio will tend to fall; conversely, when the economy goes into recession or experiences lower than normal growth, the deficit as a ratio of GDP will tend to increase. There are two reasons why the deficit ratio tends to rise, particularly in a recession when GDP growth is negative. Firstly, tax revenue will automatically fall as incomes fall and people spend less, and expenditures on unemployment benefits automatically will increase: this is the impact of the “automatic stabilisers”, so called because they automatically help to stabilise the fall in aggregate spending in the economy. Secondly, the government might also carry out discretionary changes in tax rates and expenditure, specifically, they will cut tax rates and boost spending in order to further support total spending in the economy.</p>
<p>The clearest example of these factors at work is the large rise in the deficit ratio as a result of the onset and policy response to the Great Recession of 2008-09. The ratio in the financial year 2007-08 was a comparatively modest 2.8%, fairly average for the period up until then. But as the recession took hold, the automatic stabilisers in conjunction with the discretionary fiscal stimulus enacted by the UK government caused the ratio to increase quickly and significantly to 7.3% in 2008-09 and then to a high of 9.9% in 2009-10. In response to this significant rise in the deficit ratio the government embarked on its “austerity” program and this, together with a resumption of economic growth, has resulted, as can be seen in the chart, in a sustained reduction in the deficit to GDP ratio.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-3"></span>
<img src="/post/2019-06-22-some-facts-and-myhs-about-government-deficits-and-debt_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" alt="UK Debt/GDP ratio" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2: UK Debt/GDP ratio
</p>
</div>
<p>Looking at Figure 2 showing the time path of the debt/GDP ratio, from a comparative high of 55.8% at the end of financial year 1974-75 the ratio gradually declined until the onset of the Great Recession, but again with noticeable fluctuations. At the end of 2007-08 it was 35.2%, but having been as low as 24.2% at financial year end 1990-91. The dramatic rise in the debt ratio as a consequence of the Great Recession and its aftermath is obvious and clear to see. The ratio increased year after year and until it reached a peak of 85.1% at year-end March 2017. This significant rise is of course linked, and indeed a direct consequence of, the rise in the deficit ratio. The link between the deficit and the debt ratios is, however, not one-to-one. Notice that although the deficit/GDP ratio has been reduced considerably from its peak of 9.9% down to 1.1% in financial year ending March 2019, the debt/GDP ratio has remained at its very high level, only falling slightly to 83.1% by the end of March 2019.</p>
<p>Why has the debt ratio remained high despite the significant fall in the deficit ratio? The answer lies in the fact that changes in the deficit only affect directly the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio. What happens to GDP is also of equal importance. If the debt level increases by say 2% this will only reduce the debt/GDP ratio if GDP grows by more than 2%. And although reducing the government deficit will reduce the growth in debt, it can also affect the growth in GDP, at least in the short run, because the increases in taxation and/or reductions in government spending necessary to reduce the deficit will depress total spending in the economy<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and hence how much output firms in the economy will produce. Many macroeconomists would argue that when the economy is in a major slump, trying to reduce the debt/GDP ratio by reducing the deficit will not work, as it is <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/self-defeating-austerity">self-defeating</a>; when private spending is depressed, reducing public spending too will simply prolong the recession such that the debt/GDP ratio will not fall, and could even increase.</p>
</div>
<div id="dynamics-of-deficits-and-debt" class="section level2">
<h2>Dynamics of deficits and debt</h2>
<p>Given that changes in the deficit affect the level of debt, it’s not surprising there is a specific mathematical relationship over time between the deficit/GDP ratio and the debt/GDP ratio. This relationship is known as the government’s (dynamic) budget constraint. As an equation<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
it looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\dot{b}=(g-t)+(r-x)b
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <em>b</em> is the debt/GDP ratio, (<em>g</em> - <em>t</em>) is the primary deficit<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> to GDP ratio, <em>r</em> is the nominal interest rate on government bonds (i.e. the interest rate they pay to holders of the debt), and <em>x</em> is the growth rate of money GDP</p>
<p>The equation shows how the debt/GDP ratio (<em>b</em>) evolves over time in response to changes in government spending (<em>g</em>), taxation (<em>t</em>), the interest rate on government debt (<em>r</em>), and growth in GDP (<em>x</em>) Mathematically, it’s known as a first order differential equation! And if (<em>g-t</em>) and (<em>r-x</em>) are constant values, it’s possible to trace out the time path of b.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In particular, if (r-x) is negative, because the growth rate of GDP is greater than the interest rate paid on government debt, the value of b will converge to a long run, stable value. Importantly, this will be the case even if (g-t) is positive, i.e the government continually runs a primary deficit.
Here’s a numeric example; here, starting from a debt/GDP ratio of 80%, the government runs a primary deficit each period of 1% of GDP. whilst the growth of GDP exceeds the interest rate by 5 percentage points. Over time the debt ratio declines, fairly quickly at first, to a stable long run level of 20%.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-06-22-some-facts-and-myhs-about-government-deficits-and-debt_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This might appear odd. How can the government continually run a deficit, implying more borrowing, and yet stabilise the debt ratio? The reason is that increases in debt only increase the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio; what matters too is what is happening to the denominator, GDP. If this is increasing faster than the debt, then the debt ratio will fall. This is why the growth rate of GDP is so important, and as just noted, it must exceed the interest rate paid on government debt.</p>
<p>Of course, in reality, governments will not have the same primary deficit each period, nor will the gap between the GDP growth rate and the interest rate stay the same. So a better way to use this dynamic budget constraint is to calculate what size of budget deficit is required to either keep the debt ratio stable, or reduce it. A little bit of mathematics<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> shows us that to keep the debt/GDP ratio constant a government must run a deficit to GDP equal to the current debt/GDP ratio multiplied by the growth rate of GDP. So, for example, if the current debt ratio is 80% (0.80), and the growth rate of GDP over the next period is 3% (0.03), the government could run a deficit of 2.4% (0.024 = 0.03 x 0.80) of GDP over the next period and the debt ratio would remain at 80%. Clearly, a deficit ratio of less than 2.4% would cause the debt ratio to fall, whilst a deficit of more than 2.4% of GDP would increase it.</p>
<p>Looking back at figures 1 and 2, it’s aparent that, although the UK’s defcit/GDP ratio was falling from 2009-10 onwards, it wasn’t enough to bring down the debt ratio until the last two financial years. The reason is the low rate of growth of nominal (current price) GDP. The average growth rate over the period 2010 to 2018 was 3.6%. With a debt ratio of around 75%, a deficit/GDP of around 2.7% would keep the debt/GDP stable. From 2010-11 to 2015-16 the deficit/GDP ratio was 8.5, 7.0, 7.0, 5.5, 4.8, and 3.8. Hence the rising debt ratio. In the last two financial years the deficit has been, respectively, 2.0% and 1.1% of GDP. Consequently, the debt as a percentage of GDP has begun to fall, albeit slowly.</p>

<div id="is-a-large-deficit-or-debt-bad-for-the-economy" class="section level2">
<h2>Is a large deficit or debt bad for the economy?</h2>
<p>Following the large increase, in many countries, in government deficits and debt during 2008 to 2010, there was a lot of discussion in the media about the supposed disastrous impact on the economy if they were not brought down immediately. Dire predictions were made about the the country going “bankrupt”, or the government having to default on its debt, or interest rates going through the roof. The vast majority of macroeconomists considered such predictions to be alarmist and inaccurate. And history has proven them to be correct.</p>
<p>There are three ways in which large and increasing government deficits and debt could have an adverse effect on the economy: higher interest rates, higher inflation, lower economic growth. In all three cases, the possible adverse impact only really applies when the economy is operating at or close to full employment; in times of, especially severe, recession larger deficits and more government borrowing can be beneficial as they help sustain the level of aggregate spending in the economy (a point emphasised earlier).</p>
<p>Increased government borrowing in normal (non-recession) times means the government is competing with the private sector for funds. This can lead to increases in long term interest rates which might cause private sector investment spending (on new capital equipment and housing) to fall. This is known as “crowding out”. But when the economy is in a recession or depression, private spending is necessarily reduced and much saving is not being utilised. Hence, governments can easily borrow more without having to pay higher rates of interest. But won’t purchasers of government debt nonetheless demand higher returns to compensate for an increased risk of default? Not if the country has its own currency. The government of a country that has its own currency, such as the UK, can <strong>never</strong> go bankrupt, nor does it have to default on its debt, as it can always borrow from its central bank. In other words, the central bank can create new money in order to purchase government bonds and thus redeem the debt.</p>
<p>This “monetisation” of the debt via increasing the money supply, is the second route by which larger deficits could adversely impact the economy. This is because an increased rate of growth of the money supply could generate much higher inflation. Again, however, this is unlikely to be a problem when the economy is in a severe slump like the Great Recession. The reason is that, in a slump, interest rates will be very low. In fact, short term interest rates may very well be effectively zero<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>. Thus holders of government debt are happy to swap their low yielding assets for the safer asset of money. Nor will these extra holdings of money be spent, they will be held as assets. The upshot is that this increase in the money stock does not lead to higher spending and inflation.</p>
<p>The empirical evidence on long run interest rates, the money supply and inflation in the period since government deficits and debt levels began to rise significantly confirms these predictions. Long run interest rates have not risen, indeed they have fallen to historically low levels; inflation has not increased, on the contrary it has been subdued. The following chart shows how the massive rise in the monetary base (M0)<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> of the UK, resulting from the Bank of England’s policy of <em>quantitative easing(QE)</em><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, did not lead to a huge rise in inflation.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-06-22-some-facts-and-myhs-about-government-deficits-and-debt_files/UK%20M0%20v%20Core%20Inflation.png" /></p>
<p>This next chart shows how the interest rate on 10 year UK government bonds has actually continued to fall despite the massive increase in the debt/GDP ratio.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-06-22-some-facts-and-myhs-about-government-deficits-and-debt_files/UK%20gilt%20yields%20v%20Debt%20ratio.png" /></p>
<p>A final argument against high and rising deficits and debt is that it can reduce an economy’s long run growth rate. One reason for this is the crowding out effect discussed earlier. If the increased government borrowing reduces, via higher interest rates, the rate of private capital accumulation then the rate of economic growth may decline. Of course, if the borrowing is to fund higher public investment, in better infrastructure for example, the impact on the growth rate is less clear cut. A second reason concerns taxation. Reducing the debt might involve higher levels of taxation in the future. Some economists contend that higher tax rates incur a significant disincentive effect on labour supply, effort and innovation, again reducing potential growth in the future. The evidence on the effect of tax rates on economic growth is to some extent mixed. However, it is reasonable to say that overall <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42111.pdf">the evidence</a> suggests very little impact on rates of economic growth from changes in tax rates.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Some simple evidence is shown in Figure 3. This shows the correlation for a range of European countries between the tax share of GDP and the Gross National Income per capita. If having overall higher rates of taxation had a significant, detrimental impact on economic growth then a negative correlation would be expected between a country’s share of GDP taken in taxtion and its average standard of living; lower taxed countries should grow faster than high taxed ones and thus have higher income per person. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case. There is a positive correlation between tax share and GNI per capita. In other words, the higher taxed countries have experienced the most growth. Of course, this simple correlation does not prove that higher rates of taxation necessarily lead to higher rates of economic growth.It could be that there really is a negative impact on growth of higher tax rates, but the positive correlation shown in the chart is the result of other, more dominant factors causing GNI per capita to be greater in the higher taxed countries. But if this is the case the impact of taxation on growth must be relatively small, as the evidence referred to above suggests.</p>

</div>
<p>One other, controversial, reason for this argument against high debt is worth mentioning. It was claimed in an influential paper by a couple of American economists that a robust correlation existed between high levels of debt and lower rates of economic growth. In particular, it was claimed there was a threshold level of debt of about 90% of GDP beyond which growth rates were significantly reduced. Unfortunately, the statistical calculations upon which these claims were based were subsequently found to be flawed. And other objections have also been made. So it is highly questionable whether such a 90% debt threshold actually exists. A good discussion of the debate/debacle is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt">here</a>.</p>
