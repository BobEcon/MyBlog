<h2>What’s here?</h2>
<p>This blog will be primarily about economics (but with a possible sprinkling of politics now and again!). What I’m trying do here is use my many years experience of teaching and researching economics to dispel some of the myths and confusions that surround this subject. To do this I’m going to use actual real life data (usually from official sources) so that readers can see that everything I assert is evidenced and confirmed by the facts.</p>
<p>Where what I write is mainly based on opinion rather than fact I will indicate this clearly.</p>
<p>My hope is that readers of this blog will become much better informed and knowledgeable about basic economic ideas and issues, and hence be much less likely to believe the economic nonsense that is often spoken by politicians (of all persuasions), journalists and other commentators.</p>
